= Details =

There are two command-prompts. In one command-prompt we have the Multicast Tool running in _listen_ mode, and in the other in _send_ mode.

We are executing two commands in the _send_ command-prompt: one by entering the input in the command-prompt, and the other by sending the contents of a file to the application. Both the contents are received by _listen_ mode of the application running in the background command-prompt.

Then in the _listen_ mode prompt, we give the command _bye_ to quit that version.
