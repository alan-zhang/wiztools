Many projects have started distributing their `JavaDocs` as a single Jar file. For viewing these files offline, I have to do the following:

  # Create a temporary folder
  # Extract the content of the `JavaDoc` Jar to this temporary directory
  # View the `JavaDoc` in a browser

To avoid these steps, we have the *`JavaDoc` Jar Viewer*. It does all the above. To execute it:

{{{
java -jar javadocjarviewer-NN.jar project-NN-javadoc.jar
}}}

This will open the `JavaDoc`'s _index.html_ in your default browser.
