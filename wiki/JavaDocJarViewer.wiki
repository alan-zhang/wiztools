Many projects have started distributing their JavaDocs as a single Jar file. For viewing these files offline, I have to do the following:

  # Create a temporary folder
  # Extract the content of the JavaDoc Jar to this temporary directory
  # View the JavaDoc in a browser

To avoid these steps, we have the *JavaDoc Jar Viewer*. It does all the above. To execute it:

{{{
java -jar javadocjarviewer-NN.jar project-NN-javadoc.jar
}}}

This will try to open the JavaDoc's _index.html_ in Firefox browser. If you want to open the application in another browser, say Opera, you would give:

{{{
java -Dweb.browser=opera -jar javadocjarviewer-NN.jar project-NN-javadoc.jar
}}}

== Windows Users==

In Windows, the browser executables are not in the PATH. For this, use full path:

{{{
> java -Dweb.browser="C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore" \
  -jar project-NN-javadoc.jar
}}}
