CSS @import Resolver is a command-line tool written in Java to create a aggregated CSS by reading the @import url() statements in CSS.

= Details =

In CSS you can refer to other CSS files thus:

{{{
@import url(path/to/included.css);
}}}

Such reference makes the code easy to read and maintain, but on the performance side it takes a hit---because the browser needs to make multiple HTTP requests to render this page ([http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/ more detail]).

This tool reads such CSS files and includes the content of the @import'ed file in the main CSS.

This can be done as a build time processing for building faster sites.

= Usage =

To list the command-line options:

{{{
$ java -jar css-import-resolver-NN-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h
}}}

== Limitations ==

  * The parsing is done using RegularExpression, so when @import statements are encountered inside CSS comments, they are also expanded.
  * The import resolve happens only for the top CSS, it does not happen recursively.
