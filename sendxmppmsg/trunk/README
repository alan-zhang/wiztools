* SendXMPPMessage

  This is a OSWorkflow plugin which can be used for sending
  XMPP (eg. Jabber or OpenFire) messages.

* Configuration

  A typical OSWorkflow configuration that would be defined:

  <function type="class">
    <arg name="class.name">org.wiztools.osworkflow.util.SendXMPPMessage</arg>
    <arg name="server">localhost.localdomain</arg>
    <arg name="port">5222</arg>
    <arg name="to">demo@localhost.localdomain</arg>
    <arg name="message">Hello!</arg>
    <arg name="username">admin</arg>
    <arg name="password">admin</arg>
  </function>

* Source Code

* Build

  Building this application requires Ant (http://ant.apache.org/).
  The folder structure we have followed for this project is
  based on Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/).

  To build the application:

  $ ant

* Test

  To execute UnitTest:

  $ ant test

  Before running test, make sure you are running an XMPP server
  in localhost. It should also have two users:

  1. admin (password `admin')
  2. demo (password `demo')

  Both these users should be buddies. If you don't have these
  test users, you may edit `src/test/resources/test.xml' file
  to configure the users of your system.

  Have the `demo' user logged in so that message sent from
  osworkflow is received by him.
